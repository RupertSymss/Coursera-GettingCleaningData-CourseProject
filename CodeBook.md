# Code Book
Tidy Data summary on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## About the Data:

* All variables are the mean / standard deviation of a measurement for each subject and activity. 
* All values are floating point numbers.

### Description of each Variable:

*  ID of the Activity performed by the Subject
     +  activityId 
*  Unique ID to each subject
    +  subjectId
